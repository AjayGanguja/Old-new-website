        The Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) was part of the human spaceflight program of the United States Air Force.
        The MOL evolved into a space station, for which crews would be launched on 30-day missions, and then return to
        Earth using a Gemini B spacecraft derived from NASA's Gemini spacecraft. The MOL program was officially
        announced in December 1963 as a platform to prove the utility of putting people in space for military missions;
        its use for satellite reconnaissance was a secret black project. Seventeen astronauts were selected for the
        program, including Major Robert H. Lawrence Jr., the first African American to be chosen as an astronaut. Budget
        cuts repeatedly caused postponement of the first operational flight, and improvements in technology reduced the
        benefits of a crewed space platform over an automated one. A single uncrewed test flight of the Gemini B
        spacecraft was conducted on 3 November 1966, but the MOL was canceled in June 1969 without any crewed missions
        being flown
